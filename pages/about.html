            <h2>Who We Are</h2>

            <p>Sol Y Salud (Sun & Health) was founded with a simple yet powerful idea: to bring the warmth of health education to communities across Colombia who need it most.</p>

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Our organization began when a group of passionate individuals recognized the gap in health education access between urban and rural Colombia. Inspired by the Colombian spirit of resilience and community, we set out to make a difference.</p>

            <h3>Our Team</h3>
            <p>We are a dedicated team of healthcare professionals, educators, and volunteers united by our love for Colombia and our commitment to improving lives through education.</p>

            <h3>Our Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> We approach every community with empathy and understanding</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> We believe knowledge is the foundation of health</li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> We work alongside communities, not just for them</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We maintain open communication with our supporters</li>
            </ul>
